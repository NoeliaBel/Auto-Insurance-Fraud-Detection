# Auto-Insurance-Fraud-Detection üöó
Data Science project focused on detecting fraudulent auto insurance claims.

This project employs a machine learning classification algorithm to identify fraudulent auto insurance claims. By analyzing data such as insurance policies and accident reports, the algorithm classifies claims as either fraudulent or legitimate with high accuracy. This approach enhances fraud detection and streamlines the claim processing workflow.

### Objectives üéØ
Vehicle insurers handle a large number of accident and damage claims each year. However, a significant portion of these claims may be fraudulent. Detecting fraudulent claims is crucial to reduce financial losses for insurance companies and keep insurance premiums fair for all customers.

For these reasons, the use of advanced prediction techniques to detect fraudulent claims is becoming increasingly crucial.

Therefore, we have decided to implement a fraud detection model for auto insurance that could significantly enhance the company's ability to identify fraud, support fraud prevention analysts, and direct the company‚Äôs financial resources towards claims with a higher likelihood of being fraudulent.

### Dataset üóÇÔ∏è
- The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 15,420 rows and 33 columns, including information such as vehicle details, accident data, and other relevant attributes.
- The target variable is to determine whether a claim application is fraudulent or not, represented by FraudFound_P.

### Models ‚öôÔ∏è
- Considered Models: Using PyCaret:
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3aa31c3-eb76-490a-af2a-fadb25a966d2)

- Selected Model: We have chosen the Gradient Boosting Classifier as our final model. 
- GridSearch was applied to the Gradient Boosting Classifier to optimize hyperparameters and improve model performance.
- Train and test metrics were compared to assess possible overfitting.

### Challenges and Limitations
In this project, we faced several challenges and limitations that were addressed through targeted strategies:

- Severe Class Imbalance in the Dataset - Solution: Applied SMOTE technique to balance the dataset.

- High Proportion of Categorical Variables - Solution: Used OneHotEncoder for encoding and created additional features.

- Default decision threshold (0.5) was not optimal for maximizing the model's sensitivity - Solution: Adjusted the threshold to 0.2 to improve sensitivity.

- Risk of Overfitting - Solution: Performed extensive evaluation to ensure model generalization.

### Conclusions üìù

### Future Improvements üîß
- Implementation of a scoring system that classifies clients based on their risk level.
- Development of a regression model to predict the amount of fraud by requesting additional data (e.g., fraud amount) from the client.
- Ongoing evaluation of the model
- Incorporate external data (known fraud databases and socioeconomic data)
- Implement a continuous feedback system

# Auto-Insurance-Fraud-Detection 🚗
Data Science project focused on detecting fraudulent auto insurance claims.

This project employs a machine learning classification algorithm to identify fraudulent auto insurance claims. By analyzing data such as insurance policies and accident reports, the algorithm classifies claims as either fraudulent or legitimate with high accuracy. This approach enhances fraud detection and streamlines the claim processing workflow.

### Objectives 🎯
Vehicle insurers handle a large number of accident and damage claims each year. However, a significant portion of these claims may be fraudulent. Detecting fraudulent claims is crucial to reduce financial losses for insurance companies and keep insurance premiums fair for all customers.

For these reasons, the use of advanced prediction techniques to detect fraudulent claims is becoming increasingly crucial.

Therefore, we have decided to implement a fraud detection model for auto insurance that could significantly enhance the company's ability to identify fraud, support fraud prevention analysts, and direct the company’s financial resources towards claims with a higher likelihood of being fraudulent.

### Dataset 🗂️
- The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 15,420 rows and 33 columns, including information such as vehicle details, accident data, and other relevant attributes.
- The target variable is to determine whether a claim application is fraudulent or not, represented by FraudFound_P.

### Models ⚙️

### Conclusions 📝

### Future Improvements 🔧
- Implementation of a scoring system
- Development of a regression model to predict the amount of fraud
- Ongoing evaluation of the model
- Incorporate external data (known fraud databases and socioeconomic data)
- Implement a continuous feedback system

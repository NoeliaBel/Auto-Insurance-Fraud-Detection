# Auto-Insurance-Fraud-Detection 🚗
Data Science project focused on detecting fraudulent auto insurance claims.

This project employs a machine learning classification algorithm to identify fraudulent auto insurance claims. By analyzing data such as insurance policies and accident reports, the algorithm classifies claims as either fraudulent or legitimate with high accuracy. This approach enhances fraud detection and streamlines the claim processing workflow.

### Objectives 🎯
- Fraud in automobile insurance has increased significantly in recent years. This substantial rise in fraudulent claims leads to greater scrutiny and allocation of resources by insurers to combat fraud.

- For these reasons, the use of advanced prediction techniques to detect fraudulent claims is becoming increasingly crucial.

- Therefore, we have decided to implement a fraud detection model for automobile insurance that could significantly enhance the company's ability to identify fraud, support fraud prevention analysts, and direct the company’s financial resources towards claims with a higher likelihood of being fraudulent.

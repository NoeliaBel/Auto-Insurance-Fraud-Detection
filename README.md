# Auto-Insurance-Fraud-Detection ðŸš—
Data Science project focused on detecting fraudulent auto insurance claims.

This project employs a machine learning classification algorithm to identify fraudulent auto insurance claims. By analyzing data such as insurance policies and accident reports, the algorithm classifies claims as either fraudulent or legitimate with high accuracy. This approach enhances fraud detection and streamlines the claim processing workflow.
